"""Finite State Machine framework targeted at robotics using MicroPython.

Managing a list of tasks to be excuted in sequence and execute those in sequence.

Allowing each task to provide two functions that will be called by the framework:
- start - will be called once when the task is about to be executed for the first time.
- beat - will be called over and over again to process events and thus react on those.
Both functions have to be non-blocking

Offering the ability to:
- Replace the current task with a sequence of other tasks.
- Have the beat function called at a regular interval.
- Have a task check if execution time exceeded a specific time.
